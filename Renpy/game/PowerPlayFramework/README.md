The PowerPlay Framework provides some systems and support for modules.

All modules must be registered with the framework.

To pre-process and register modules, place modules in the Modules folder and run "process_modules.bat" (or "process_modules.sh" depending on your operating system).

Read Modules/README.md for more information on modules.
